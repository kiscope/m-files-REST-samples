M-Files API Samples for RESTfully integrating ERP or other 3rd Party systems

The written JavaScript Code will most likely not comply with all best practices, since the goal of this is not perfect JS but a starting point in getting around the API calls of M-Files.

[Here is some draft dcumentation, work in Progress...](http://slides.com/kiscope/m-files-api-documentation#/)

###Following features are available in the API helper:

    *	addrecentlyaccessedbyme:  Add a Document to the Recent List
    *	attachdocument: Attach a Document (without File Handling!)
    *	addtofavorites: Add a Document to your Favorites
    *	getcheckedouttome : Get all Documents Checked-Out by me
    *	getcheckoutstatus: Get the Document Check-Out Status
    *	getclassdefinitions: Get Class Definitions
    *	getdynamicmetadataviewmodel: This is a work in progress for Dynamically rendering all Metadata card and giving the ability to read & update metadata
    *	getfavorites: Get the Favorite Documents
    *	getmetadata: Get the Metadata of the current Document
    *	getpropertiedefs: Get Property Definitions
    *	getrecentlyaccessedbyme: Get Recently Accessed Docs by me
    *	getversionhistory: Get all Versions of the current Document
